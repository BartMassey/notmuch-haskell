You can build jmh using either the Makefile or the jmh.cabal
provided.

Here's the packages that currently need to be installed on
my box to get jmh to build.

  strict-0.3.2: hackage
  mime-string-0.4: hackage
  parsec-3.0.0: Debian unstable
  time-1.1.2.4: Debian unstable
  regex-posix-0.93.2: Debian unstable

Note that if cabal is used it will complain about jmh
depending on parsec-3 while network depends on parsec-2.
This seems to be harmless.
